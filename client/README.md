# Dear Blueno Frontend

## Environment Variables

To develop locally, you can use the following environment variables (use a `.env` file to store them):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = "http://localhost:5000"
```

## Getting Started with Next.js

The frontend portion of this project is powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

Installs the frontend dependencies necessary for development.

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.\
This optimizes the build for the best performance, so it can be run on a Node.js server with `npm start`.\
To export the app to static HTML (and lose some of the dynamic Next.js features), use `npm run export`.

See the section about [deployment](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more information on how to deploy your app.
